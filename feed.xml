      <content type="html" xml:base="https://storiescovid.in/2020/05/14/episode2/">&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flowers for my mother&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ep2_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;helicopter showering flowers on healthcare workers&quot; class=&quot;center-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been given the duty of saving lives by staying inside. But as I look at my mother, dread creeps back into my mind. Mother hasn’t had the blessed luck to stay inside and save lives. You see, my mother is one of those people who are literally saving people’s lives. I have heard numerous stories of her adventures at work. Some fill you with hope, some scar you for life and all of them make you look at her with wonder. I have always been proud of her work. But this time, everyday as she steps out, I imagine invisible foes ready to bring her down. It feels as if this time the stakes are too high, for she is not only fighting a disease about which we learn something new everyday, but also the helplessness of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soldiers are armoured when they go to the front line. I watch my mother put on her armour - her white sari, white apron and a flimsy surgical mask. Flimsy? Because the health centres are out of N95s. I don’t even want to bring up the debacle involving PPEs. Everyday I send her off with this thought that maybe today is the unlucky day when her fragile armour falls short and Coronavirus comes home. The horror of the possibility perturbs me and leaves me terrified. I ask her to make fake excuses and stay home. I ask her to outright resign and just stay home. I brush aside any grand ideas of public service and ask her to not go out. When it comes to your loved ones, all ideas of selflessness seem futile. But she smiles and reminds me of the oath she took when she chose this profession. I curse her oath, I curse her selfless heart. But more than that, I curse this failed system. The system that spends billions on weapons of mass destruction but turns impotent when it comes to equipping the health professionals with adequate tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day there were flower showers to show appreciation. The same day I saw exasperation on my mother’s face as she asked me if this gesture means that now all healthcare workers will get enough protective equipment. Next day she goes out to work in the same old attire. I look at her walk away and agonize over the futility of flowers they showered for my mother.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://storiescovid.in/2020/05/07/episode1/">&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where masked men stand in chalked circles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ep1_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;person inside a circle&quot; class=&quot;center-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s something outside you. Perhaps it’s inside you too. You don’t know. Perhaps you are infected. And can infect. Just not showing yet. You step out when you run out of bread. The neighbourhood is suddenly still. With a silence slowly scooping away. Everything you had known here. Every face is now a mask. Scared. Scary. Your local shopkeeper doesn’t smile at you today. Perhaps he doesn’t recognise you. You’re wearing a mask too. There’s this queue. Where masked men stand in chalked circles. Carefully away. From each other. Carefully clutching. What they think they own. Bags, keys, wallets. You stand too. Suddenly someone falls. On the third circle from the shop. Nobody rushes. Nobody touches. He lies still. You watch him breathe. He isn’t dead you think. Gets up slowly. Nobody speaks. Somebody leaves. And then it’s your turn to get in. You notice the price of bread. Is still the same. Just a number. But familiar. A tiny bit that hasn’t changed. — &lt;em&gt;Avishek Parui&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bugs Galore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ep1_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bug on the hand&quot; class=&quot;center-img&quot; /&gt;
I don’t squash bugs. I blow them away or if they are particularly large, I make them amble on an A4 sheet and shake or flick them down from my 4th floor balcony. I like to think that they fell to their deaths and not just fly away to a different window, balcony or a tree, an act that I call these days “assisted suicide” - blame it on the TV series and movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While packing enough chillis at the supermarket to last a few weeks, a small bug landed on my index finger. Instinctively I blew on it, but there it was, still, round, small, impervious and unshaken, like our lockdown efforts that just blow up in our faces everyday. A realization set in slowly as I felt the settling perspiration on my lips and heard the breaths I drew - this is going to stay a while. — &lt;em&gt;Shantam Raj&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;बहुत तकलीफ़ है मुझको अभी ज़माने में&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ep1_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;person looking out&quot; class=&quot;center-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center-text hindi-text&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;बहुत तकलीफ़ है मुझको अभी ज़माने में,&lt;br /&gt;
दीवार-ओ-दर मुझे घेरे हैं आशियाने में।&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;बनाने बैठता हूं जब उदासी की तस्वीर,&lt;br /&gt;
उतर जाती है मेरी ज़िन्दगी बनाने में।&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;बहाने हम नहीं कर पाते तुमसे मिलने के,&lt;br /&gt;
तसल्ली हम ये ख़ुद को देते हैं बहाने में।&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;यही हम सोचकर ले आए साथ घर अपना,&lt;br /&gt;
न ही सहरा न ही है दश्त इस फ़साने में।&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;ये कमरा और दीवारें तो आज़मा ही चुके,&lt;br /&gt;
तो क्या ही हर्ज़ है ख़ुद को भी आज़माने में।&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;कि यूं तो ख़र्च खुद को बेहिसाब करते हैं,&lt;br /&gt;
लगाएं वक़्त ये ख़ुद को ज़रा कमाने में।&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;इसी ख़ुरफ़ात में ख़ुद को सुबह जगाते हैं,&lt;br /&gt;
सुनेंगे आज क्या चिड़ियों के चहचहाने में।&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;बराए नाम ही उम्मीद है बची लेकिन,&lt;br /&gt;
बराए नाम होगी कारगर बचाने में।&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
